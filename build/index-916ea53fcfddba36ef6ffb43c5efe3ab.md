# Open Science Catalog

The [Open Science Catalog (OSC)](https://opensciencedata.esa.int/) is a key component of the ESA EO Open Science framework. It is a publicly available web-based application designed to provide easy access to scientific resources including geoscience products, workflows, experiments and documentation from activities and projects funded by ESA under the EO Programme. 


There are three ways to add information to the OSC:

### 1: Using a Visual GUI

- [Git Clerk](./git_clerk_example.md) - A guide for using the Git Clerk tool which is a user interface for automatically creating product entries and creating a Pull Request in the OSC GitHub Repo.

### 2: Manually opening a PR
- [Directly editing the json files](./osc_pr_manual.ipynb) - A guide for manually creating Product entries. Requires knowledge of git.

- [Generating OSC files using pystac](./osc_pr_pystac.ipynb) - A guide for creating Product entries using pystac. Requires knowledge of git and Python.

### 3: Using one of the platform tools
- [DeepCode](https://github.com/deepesdl/deep-code) - An example using DeepCode: a library for automatically generating product entries for DeepESDL datasets.
