subtitle: Pangeo meets EarthCODE
description: This training introduces participants to the EDC Pangeo Cloud Platform and scalable geospatial analysis using Python tools. Participants will learn how to access data programmatically from the EarthCODE Open Science Catalog via the STAC API, explore Zarr-formatted datasets, and use Xarray with Dask for efficient data processing. The session includes a hands-on example and guidance on saving and publishing results back to the EarthCODE Catalog.
