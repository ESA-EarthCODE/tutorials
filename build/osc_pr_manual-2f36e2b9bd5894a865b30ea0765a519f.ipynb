    "# Adding new content to Open Science Catalogue with Pull Request (PR)\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Open Science Catalog (OSC)](https://opensciencedata.esa.int/) is a key component of the ESA EO Open Science framework. It is a publicly available web-based application designed to provide easy access to scientific resources including geoscience products, workflows, experiments and documentation from activities and projects funded by ESA under the EO Programme. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Open Science Catalog is built on the Spatio Temporal Asset Catalog (STAC), which is a standardised format for describing geospatial data. Throught the open source STAC browser, the catalog allows users to browse and explore interlinked elements such as themes, variables, EO missions, projects, products, workflows, and experiments, all described using STAC-compliant JSON files. This schema ensures that these can be easily reused by other scientists and automated workflowss and correclty displayed in the web browser. Data, workflows, and experiments are documented in the catalogue primarily through enriched metadata and direct links to the corresponding research outcomes. The physical location of these resources is typically indicated via the Project Results Repository or other secure external repositories. Further details on the OSC format can be found [here](https://github.com/ESA-EarthCODE/open-science-catalog-metadata/wiki/System-Design-Document-%E2%80%90-v1.0.0). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding information to the OSC\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three ways to add information to the OSC.\n",
    "- **Manually opening a pull request (this tutorial)**\n",
    "- Using the GUI editor.\n",
    "- Using one of the platform specific tools\n",
    "\n",
    "**This notebook describes how you can add information to the OSC by manually creating and editting json files that describe STAC Collections and Catalogs.** The steps to add information in this way are:\n",
    "1. Fork the repository\n",
    "2. Add the information about project/product/workflow/variables in STAC json format.\n",
    "3. Open a PR to merge the new information into the OSC.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general most of the information that you need, is already in your data or project documentation, so you will NOT need to generate anything new. **All information that you provide will be automatically validated and manually verified by an EarthCODE team member.** Therefore, you can use the automatic validation from the CI to make the appropriate changes to the format or information you provide. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Forking the repository\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the OSC metadata is fully hosted on GitHub. Use your personal GitHub account to cotnribute to the catalog. If you do not have an account, you need to setup a new GitHub account: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/creating-an-account-on-github. \n",
    "\n",
    "To contribute your research outputs, you need to create valid STAC objects and commit them to the [open-science-catalog-metadata repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ESA-EarthCODE/open-science-catalog-metadata). \n",
    "The first step in this process is to fork the `open-science-catalog-metadata` repository, that will create your own copy of the Open Science Catalog. ( More information about how to do this in GitHub is available here: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a OSC copy, you should have a look at the folder structure and information for an existing Item of the same type as the one you want to add - product, project, workflow, variable etc. This will give you an idea of the required information for a valid STAC Object. These STAC objects, stored as JSON files, are be automatically processed and rendered in the catalog viewer. "

    "\n",
    "After you forked the repository, you can start adding the required information. [This document](https://github.com/stac-extensions/osc?tab=readme-ov-file) explains the Open Science Catalog Extension to the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification. There are different requirements depending on the catalog entry you are trying to add.\n",
    "\n",
    "```TIP. \n",
    "Sometimes its easier to copy the folder of existing project/product/workflow, rename it and start changing its information.\n",

    "\n",
    "Projects are the containers that have the top level information about your work. It is the first type of information you should provide. Typically an OSC project corresponds to a project financed by the European Space Agency - Earth Observation programme. Before creating new project, check if your project is not already on the [list of onboarded projects](https://opensciencedata.esa.int/projects/catalog). In such case you can use your project entry and only update it where needed.\n",
